## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Live Site URL: [My Fylo Site](https://smonetc.github.io/Fylo_frontendmentor_challenge/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

I really learned the power of Flexbox while working on this landing page. I have a lot to learn and need to get my hands dirty more often in figuring out flexbox and grid layouts in CSS. It'll be a challenge but looking forward to it.

### Continued development

This helped me learn that I need to get a better understanding of CSS layouts such ass Flexbox and Grid. I have a lot more to learn and looking forward to it.
